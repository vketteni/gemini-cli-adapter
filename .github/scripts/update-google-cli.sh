**Next Steps: Manual Merge Required**

The automated part of the update is complete. Now, you must manually merge the changes.

1.  **Use a Diff Tool:**
    Open your preferred visual diffing tool to compare the following two directories:
    - **Your local module:** `$LOCAL_PATH`
    - **The upstream code:** `$TEMP_COMPARISON_DIR`

    *Suggestion: In VS Code, right-click on the first folder, select 'Select for Compare', then right-click on the second folder and select 'Compare with Selected'.*

2.  **Port Relevant Changes:**
    Carefully review the differences and manually port the necessary updates from the upstream code into your local module. Remember to adapt the changes to the refactored architecture of Open CLI.

3.  **Commit Your Changes:**
    Once you have integrated the changes, commit them to your repository.
