# Analysis of `packages/cli/src/ui/privacy/PrivacyNotice.tsx`

This file defines the `PrivacyNotice` React component, which serves as a container for different privacy notices based on the user's authentication type.

## Core Module Interactions

The `PrivacyNotice` component interacts with the core module through the `Config` object, imported from `@google/gemini-cli-core`.

*   **`Config` object**: The `config` prop, typed as `Config` from `@google/gemini-cli-core`, is used to determine which specific privacy notice to display.

*   **`AuthType` enum**: The `AuthType` enum, also imported from `@google/gemini-cli-core`, is used in conjunction with the `config` object to branch the rendering logic. Specifically, `config.getContentGeneratorConfig()?.authType` is accessed to get the current authentication type (e.g., `AuthType.USE_GEMINI`, `AuthType.USE_VERTEX_AI`, `AuthType.LOGIN_WITH_GOOGLE`). This indicates that the core module provides information about the authentication method, which influences the UI's behavior.
