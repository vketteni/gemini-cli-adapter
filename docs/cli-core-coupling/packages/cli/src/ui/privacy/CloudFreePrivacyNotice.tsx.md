# Analysis of `packages/cli/src/ui/privacy/CloudFreePrivacyNotice.tsx`

This file defines the `CloudFreePrivacyNotice` React component, which displays a privacy notice for users of the free tier of Gemini Code Assist.

## Core Module Interactions

The primary interaction with the core module is through the `Config` object, which is imported from `@google/gemini-cli-core`.

*   **`Config` object**: The `config` prop, typed as `Config` from `@google/gemini-cli-core`, is passed to the `usePrivacySettings` hook. This hook likely uses the `Config` object to read and update privacy-related settings, such as the `dataCollectionOptIn` status.

Specifically, the `updateDataCollectionOptIn` function returned by `usePrivacySettings` (which receives the `Config` object) is called when the user selects an option in the radio button. This indicates that the `Config` object is used to persist the user's privacy choices within the core module's configuration.
