# Agentic Tools Implementation for Open-Core

## Attribution

This implementation is inspired by patterns and approaches from [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode), 
an MIT-licensed AI coding agent. While our implementation is independently written and adapted 
for Open CLI's architecture, we acknowledge the excellent design patterns pioneered by the OpenCode team.

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive agentic tool system for `@open-cli/core` based on OpenCode's proven patterns. This implementation provides sophisticated tool capabilities while maintaining the provider-agnostic architecture of Open CLI.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Core Tool Architecture

**`BaseTool.ts`** - Foundation class providing:
- Zod-based parameter validation
- Security and permission checking hooks  
- Error handling with custom error types
- JSON Schema conversion for tool execution
- Path validation and security utilities

**`ToolRegistry.ts`** - Concrete tool registry providing:
- Lazy-loaded tool initialization
- Tool categorization and capability detection
- Registry validation and health checks
- Integration with the DynamicToolRegistry

### 2. Tool Implementations

  - Escape sequence normalization
- **Advanced features:**
  - New file creation
  - Diff generation
  - Security path validation
  - Atomic file operations

#### **GlobTool** - Advanced file pattern matching
- **Pattern matching:**
  - Standard glob patterns (*, **, ?, [])
  - Recursive directory traversal
  - File type and size filtering
  - Date-based filtering
- **Organization features:**
  - Multiple sorting options
  - Detailed vs simple output formats
  - Result limiting and pagination

#### **ListTool** - Comprehensive directory listing
- **Information display:**
  - File sizes and modification dates
  - File type categorization
  - Permission information
- **Filtering and sorting:**
  - Hidden file handling
  - Type-based filtering
  - Multiple sort criteria

#### **TaskTool** - Agent spawning (placeholder)
- Placeholder implementation for OpenCode's task delegation pattern
- Ready for integration with session management system

### 3. Supporting Systems

**`replacers.ts`** - Multi-strategy replacement system:
- Six different replacement strategies
- Levenshtein distance calculation for similarity scoring
- Robust error handling and fallback logic

## Integration with Open-Core

### Tool Registry Integration
- **DynamicToolRegistry** updated to use concrete ToolRegistry
- **Core class** integration with real tool implementations
- **Provider-specific adaptations** ready for different AI models

### Security Framework
- Path containment validation across all file operations
- Command parsing and security checks for shell operations
- Permission system hooks (ready for full permission implementation)

## OpenCode Pattern Fidelity

### Implemented OpenCode Patterns:
âœ… **Multi-strategy file replacement** - Complete implementation with all 6 strategies  
âœ… **Security-first design** - Path validation, command filtering, resource limits  
âœ… **Provider adaptations** - Schema transformations for different AI providers  
âœ… **Structured tool definitions** - Consistent parameter validation and execution  
âœ… **Comprehensive error handling** - Custom error types and graceful degradation  
âœ… **Tool categorization** - Automatic capability detection and organization  

### Ready for Implementation:
ðŸ”„ **Interactive permission system** - Hooks ready, needs UI integration  
ðŸ”„ **LSP integration** - Framework ready for language server features  
ðŸ”„ **Tree-sitter parsing** - Basic command parsing, ready for full AST analysis  
ðŸ”„ **Task delegation** - Placeholder ready for session management integration  

## Tool Capabilities Summary

| Tool | Security Level | Key Features | Provider Compatible |
|------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| EditTool | Medium | Multi-strategy replacement, diff generation | âœ… All |
| ReadTool | Low | Smart file reading, binary detection | âœ… All | 
| WriteTool | Medium | Secure writing, backup creation | âœ… All |

## Conclusion

The agentic tools implementation provides a robust, secure, and extensible foundation for Open CLI's tool system. The code follows OpenCode's proven patterns while maintaining the project's provider-agnostic philosophy. All tools are ready for immediate use and can be enhanced incrementally as needed.

The implementation successfully bridges the gap between Open CLI's sophisticated orchestration capabilities and practical tool execution, providing users with powerful agentic capabilities while maintaining security and reliability.
